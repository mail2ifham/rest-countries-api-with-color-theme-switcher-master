While working on this project, I gained valuable experience with:

- Fetching and displaying data from a REST API
- Implementing a dark/light theme switcher using React context
- Creating responsive layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Building a multi-page application with React Router
- Handling user interactions like search and filtering

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:
